description: Docs-as-code implementation with DITA-OT and GitHub actions for CI/CD

## Workflow overview
- `μ/jjjjguevara` documentation is created and maintained locally in the author's workstation
	- Documentation is organized in a defined DITA structure
- Changes are commited into to the **dita** branch of the `μ/jjjjguevara` project in GitHub
- When a new version of the site's documentation is ready, the **dita** branch is commited into the `μ/jjjjguevara` **main** branch
- [DITA-OT action](https://github.com/dita-ot/dita-ot-action) is triggered on GitHub to render the output into `.html` static content on the **main** branch
