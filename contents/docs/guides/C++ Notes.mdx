### 1.2 Summary
#### 1.2.1 Synthesis
- Initially known as C with classes
- Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup
- Extended from C
- C++ is a compiled language
	- Requires a compilation step to be readable by the Operating System
- The development cycle of an interpreted language is simpler
	- Source code -> Run
- The development cycle of compiled languages is
	- Source code -> Preprocessor -> Compiler -> Linker -> Run
		1. Preprocessor
			- Expanding macros
			- Providing conditional compilation
			- Combining source files with included header files into a single file
			- The output is a larger file called the translation unit
		2. Compiler
			- Takes the source code from each translation unit and compiles it into object code
			- The object code includes a symbol table that allows it to link with code in other object files, including libraries
			- The object file is not an executable
		3. Linker
			- Takes the object files and resolves their interdependencies
			- Combines the object files into something the OS can run
			- The output of the linker is an executable

- **Use cases**
	- Application

- **Versions of C++**
	- C++98 / C++03

	- C++14 - December 2014
	- C++17 - December 2017
	- C++20 - December 2020

- **C++ topics**
	- Basic syntax
	- Data types, operators, and functions
	- Classes and objects
	- Templates - programming framework
	- Standard Template Library (STL)

**Syntax Overview**
- `statement` - unit of code terminated by `;`
	- call functions
	- declare variables
	- operate on expressions
- `function` - contained by `{}`
	- larger unit of code
	- may contain many statements
	- reused and called by statements
- `main function` - represented by `int main()`
	- main entry point of any C++ program
	- main is called by the OS when the program first launches
- `variable`
	- holds a value/s for later use
	- variables must be declared befor being used
- `#include`
	- most C++ files have 1 or more `#include` directives
	- tipically near the top of the file
	- used to import libraries for use in the code
		- libraries are external files

**Anatomy of a C++ program**
- `whitespace` - any characters normally invisible
	- Usually ignored, unless required to distinguish between two words or tokens
- `comments` - code annotations that are ignored by the compiler
	- `//` - single-line comment
	- `/*` `*/`  - multi-line comment
- `main function`
	- C++ programs must have a main function
	- can have arguments to parse the command line
		1. integer
		2. array of strings
- `functions`
	- enclosed in `{}`
	- runs whenever it's called
	- if run, main returns an integer value
		- `0` = the program exited normally
		- `1` = error condition encountered
	- A function that returns a **type** must always return a **value** of that type
		- The only exception is the main function, where 0 is pressumed unless specified
- `#include`
	- instructs the preprocessor to include a header to pass to the compiler
	- it's rare for a program not to include a header file
- `printf` - printing output
- `format` -
- `print()` - future print
- `namespaces` - allows to define names without conflicting with names already in used
	- `::` - scope operator
	- `using` - imports a name from the namespace

**Statements and expressions**
- `statement` - unit of code terminated by `;`
	- analogous to a line of code
	- treated as a unit of execution
- `expression` - anything that returns a value, regardless if the value is used
	- may be part of a statement or the statement itself
- `identifiers` - provide readable names to variables, functions, classes, objects, labels, and defined types
	- May not begin with a numeral
	- ISO Latin Alphabet
	- Western Arabic Numerals
	- ASCII Underscore
	- May not conflict with reserved the 73 keywords or 11 alternative tokens
	- Case sensitive Az != aZ
	- Non-latin characters are implementation-dependent
	- It's recomended to keep identifiers under 31 characters long
	- Initial _ should be avoided
	- Consistency is key

**Defining variables**
- `variables` - may be declared with either ` =` or `{}`
	- ` =` is also known as the assignment operator
	- Variable types:
		- `const` - constant variable - the value cannot be changed once defined (read only or immutable)
			- `const` is an example of a variable *qualifier*
		- `int` - integer variable
		- `auto` - allows the compiler to determine the type of the variable
			- i.e. if the value of the type is an integer `47` the compiler will determine `auto = int`
			- this type still requires initialization

**Pointers and references**
- First we must understand how `variables` work
- A `variable` is a *typed* and *named* **location** in memory
	- Definition - `int x;`, memory is *allocated* for a value of *type* `int`, associated with the *name* `x`
	- Assignment - `x = 1`, the integer value `1` is *copied* into the **memory location** associated with the integer variable `x`
	- Definition - `int y;`, the name `y` represents a different integer in a different memory location than `x`
	- Assignment - `y = x`, the value from the variable *named* `x` is copied into the variable *named* `y`
		- Both variables occupy separate *locations* in memory and separate *definitions* but hold the same *value*
- Variable *names* are effectively used as *indexes* to map to a memory address and a specific data type
- C++ also uses so called *pointer* types
	- In C++, pointers are type-aware
	- like their name denotes, pointers *point* to a value instead of carrying the value themselves
	- `int* ip;` - point to `int` value - the space before or after `*` is ignored by the compiler
	- `ip = &x;` - `& = address of operator` - returns the address of an object
	- `y = *ip;` - `dereference operator` - we access the value pointed to by the pointer - equals `y = x`
	- A reference type is similar to a pointer but
		- they don't use `*` dereference a reference (doesn't require special punctuation)
		- the reference always holds the referenced variable - more akin to an alias
		- there's no syntax to change a reference - once defined it can't be changed
	- It's good practice to make a reference `const` anytime you declare it

**Conditionals**
- Conditional statements allow you to run one block of code or another based on a condition
- If the condition evaluates as `true`, then the statement-block will be executed
- The statement-block may be one or more statements enclosed in `{}`

**Loops**
- A loop creates a flow that only ends when the condition becomes `false`
- C++ has 2 versions of the loop - one inherited from C and the other specific to C++
-

#### 1.2.2 Analysis
- when a qualifier precedes a type in a variable, the qualifier becomes part of the type
	- `const int` makes `int` a constant variable - `const int` is now the type
-
