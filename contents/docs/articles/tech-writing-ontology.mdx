<Note title="Takeaways" type="warning">
- Technical writing has evolved hand-in-hand with science, engineering and technology - also risen in support to the so-called *techniques*: arts, trades, crafts, or any activity for which a structured canon or body of work exists
- Technical writing is (**1**) a rational construction that emerges from classifying and encoding preexisting technical knowledge and imposing an interpretable structure to it **AND** (**2**) a deterministic activity whose objectives can be critiqued and interpreted through means of scientific reasoning
</Note>

**Note:** The initial ambition of this draft is to propose a working model for technical writing, but could evolve to the level of a proper *treatise* if given the right stimulus and enough fermentation time. For now this serves only as a quick overview or *exposé* of its ins and outs.

The knowledge we have today about our history in this world has been distilled and presented to us by others —during our formative years or later— through the dissemination of historical accounts, historical artifacts, or archival records. These *stories and relics* conform the material evidence of the existence of lives past, and the pass of time itself.

Among these *stories and relics*, certainly the most powerful are those which recount practical or theoretical scientific and technical knowledge. Whether we talk about yesterday's moon missions, today's large language models, everyday trades and crafts, or even our political institutions, our power to transform the world and operate in it rests chiefly in our ability to build resilient structures and processes, which come about through collective and iterative trial, error and data collection. All in all, no discipline or area of human knowledge would hold its ground if it wasn't *standing on the shoulders of giants* who cared to share their findings.

To begin our discussion about what makes recounts of technical knowledge different from other *stories and relics*, we'll start by proposing a set of definitions, the purpose of which is to provide *operability* to our field, similar to the way mathematicians dealt with geometry for thousands of years: by defining sets of axioms.

It's also worth noting that these definitions follow the critical spirit of a philosophy of science known as **circularism**. For the purposes of this piece, we won't dive into the "phylogenesis" of other philosophies of science nor the confrontations between them. The definitions presented here must be taken as self-contained truths, but which owe their origin to a broader and more sophisticated system of thinking otherwise known as *gnosiological materialism*.

Our initial set of working *thesis* or axioms attest that...
1. **Technical writing** is the result of classifying *technical information* and imposing an interpretable structure to it
2. **Technical documentation** is the collection of structured technical writing materials within a specific discipline or category
3. **Technical information** is the written and symbolic representation (data) of technical insight and scientific knowledge that originates from experimentation *or* iteration within a structured body of work (category) or from general empirical evidence (technique)
4. The **interpreter**, transducer or *classifier* of technical information is generally known as a technical writer

Problems that immediately follow from these assumptions are the definitions of *structure*, *science*, *technique*, *system*, or even *communication*. We will take care only of the idea of *system* for now.

As we hold true that the technical writer is a mere *interpreter* of preexisting technical knowledge, with no operating influence over the nature of the materials it tries to classify, we should expect only that the source material for such classification belongs to a defined **system** (category, technique, etc) with real agency in the world, and reject unstructured inputs as unclassifiable or non-technical. We will apply the following notions to help us circumscribe this idea of **system** (Quintanilla 2022):
- A technical system `T = [C,S,E]`, is an action system, characterized by its composition `C`, its structure `S` and its environment `E`
	1. Components `C = [M , I ]` of a technical system may be intentional `I` or unintentional `M`
		- Unintentional components include raw materials, energy and technical equipment, or material parts, previously available, incorporated into the system
		- The intentional components include system operators or users
	2. The technical system structure `S = [W,K]` is characterized by the `W` set of actions and transformation processes (work operations), and the `K` set of management or control actions of those processes, which consists of the normal operation of the system
	3. The environment `E = [O, R]` of the technical system is the set of specific entities with which the technical system interacts, between which we distinguish two subsets: the subset `O` of entities whose transformation, manipulation, or control constitutes the intentional purpose of the system, and the subset `R` of entities whose transformation actually occurs as a result of the operation of the system



To us, this idea of **system** is nested in what is known as the *gnoseological space* - a space in which all of the components, primary elements, formal and material parts, etc. of positive sciences and related disciplines are organized (García Sierra 2021). This space is comprised of 3 axes with 3 figures each:

| Axes             | Figures                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Semantical axis  | terms, operations, and relationships  |
| Syntactical axis | referentials, phenomena, and essences |
| Pragmatic axis   | autologisms, dialogisms, and norms    |

Surely, mapping out the inner workings of a system would immediately enable us to identify and broadly classify the underpinnings of any defined set of technical information inputs. Calling upon this set of axes and figures is a most potent platform to understand and describe the internal structure of a given technology as well. Yet, a working model for technical writing cannot stop at the interpretation and classification of technical information. The models we use to communicate information are strictly different from the ones that give way to scientific or technical insights in the real world.

To understand how information is structured and *encoded* in a way that's most useful to an audience, we'll present some communication principles next.

## Editing, style, and other generalities

### Addressing the *curse of knowledge*
The **curse of knowledge** means recognizing the fact that people come from different backgrounds and levels of expertise. Long exposure to a subject will make you take shortcuts in communication, so it becomes sparsely and to the point. This is great when communicacting with your peers within specific contexts, but something unsurprisingly puzzling to a newcomer in the field. To avoid this pitfall, one must assume a position of intellectual integrity, not arguing too much over the terms used (*logomachy*).

This implies a couple of things, namely...
- Do not take the navigability of your content for granted. If you land on any page of your set of documents, you should immediately be able to identify:
	- The branch of documentation it belongs to
	- The outline or hierarchy within the table of contents
	- The version, revision number, or publication date
	- The author, editor, or collaborator
	- The title, subtitle, or section number
	- The page number or individual identifier

- It should be made obvious whenever *terms, footnotes, lists, figures, tables* or any other element is indexed
- It should be made clear where a section starts *or* ends
- Do whatever you can to remain specific and consistent. Technical terms should never be replaced by synonyms, as they refer to specific things within your subject area
- Terms and sentences should be structured consistently. For example, if you're giving instructions by a checklist or list of actions, you will always make clear which step you're refering to by assigning a visible number to it and initiating every sentence with an action verb
- Specificity is always relative to your set of documentation. Terms which are industry-standard and by all means applicable according to every manual or dictionary under the sun, might not be as effective if your intended audience has already grown accustomed to a way of doing things
- Buzzwords should be eliminated altogether in favor of layterms. Acronyms should be avoided, and if not possible, they must be properly introduced and clearly indexed

### The distinction between *concept* and *idea*

We consider **concepts** and **ideas** as distinctly different rational units. For one part, *ideas* designate historical entities with evolutionary traits. Ideas change with time and space. Numerous disciplines operate with different notions of the same idea simultaneously. Different cultures hold conflicting views of the same idea. Different languages render ideas with varying levels of nuance and resolution. Ideas transcend the specific structure of the discipline or category that implements them. Some names of ideas are *progress, quality, improvement, freedom, order, value, time, nation, democracy, virtue, happiness*, etc.

Concepts on the other hand are category-specific tools that provide operability to it. Modulations of the same concept may exist within a discipline, and equal terms may sometimes be used to designate different concepts. This is very succinctly exemplified in music. For a classical musician, the concept of time is naturally blurred; it depends on the indications of the director, their own ability, and the composer's engravings on the sheet music. Time-keeping in jazz works differently; there the composer and the sheet music lose priority in favor of the band playing with *swing*, *in-the-pocket*, etc. For a music recording engineer the concept of time is closer to a physicist's notion of time; it rests on the precision of the clock on its tracking converters, the latency of its computer drivers, or the gird of its digital audio workstation. All these terms have risen as modulations of a single **concept of time**, but encapsulate very precise and distinct notions of it.

When referring to technical terms, we shall never lose sight of whether we're talking about a concept or an idea, especially when they're seemingly intertwined.

> The Shakespearean notion of *world as stage* is the **idea** - the literary topic (or trope) of *world as stage* is the **concept**
