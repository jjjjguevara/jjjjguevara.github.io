title: The why and how of Technical Writing
description: A first overview of the ontology of technical documentation

<Note title="Takeaways" type="warning">
- Technical writing has evolved hand-in-hand with science, engineering and technology - also risen in support to the so-called *techniques*: arts, trades, crafts, or any activity for which a structured canon or body of work exists
- Technical writing is (**1**) a rational construction that emerges from classifying and encoding preexisting technical knowledge and imposing an interpretable structure to it **AND** (**2**) a deterministic activity whose objectives can be critiqued and interpreted through means of scientific reasoning

The knowledge we have today about our history in this world has been distilled and presented to us by others —during our formative years or later— through the dissemination of historical accounts, historical artifacts, or archival records. These *stories and relics* conform the material evidence of the existence of lives past, and the pass of time itself.

Among these *stories and relics*, certainly the most powerful are those which recount practical or theoretical scientific and technical knowledge. Whether we talk about yesterday's moon missions, today's large language models, everyday trades and crafts, or even our political institutions, our power to transform the world and operate in it rests chiefly in our ability to build resilient structures and processes, which come about through collective and iterative trial, error and data collection. All in all, no discipline or area of human knowledge would hold its ground if it wasn't *standing on the shoulders of giants* who cared to share their findings.

To begin our discussion about what makes recounts of technical knowledge different from other *stories and relics*, we'll start by proposing a set of definitions, the purpose of which is to provide *operability* to our field, similar to the way mathematicians dealt with geometry for thousands of years: by defining sets of axioms.

It's also worth noting that these definitions follow the critical spirit of a philosophy of science known as **descriptivism**, in its gnosiological *flavor*. For the purposes of this piece, we won't dive into the "phylogenesis" of other philosophies of science nor the confrontations between them. The definitions presented here must be taken as self-contained truths, but which owe their origin to a broader and more sophisticated system of thinking otherwise known as *gnosiological materialism*.

Our initial set of working *thesis* or axioms attest that...
1. **Technical writing** is the result of classifying *technical information* and imposing an interpretable structure to it
2. **Technical documentation** is the collection of structured technical writing materials within a specific discipline or category
3. **Technical information** is the written and symbolic representation (data) of technical insight and scientific knowledge that originates from experimentation *or* iteration within a structured body of work (category) or from general empirical evidence (technique)
4. The **interpreter**, transducer or *classifier* of technical information is generally known as a technical writer

Problems that immediately follow from these assumptions are the definitions of *science*, *technique* and *system*. We will take care only of the idea of *system* for now.

As we hold true that the technical writer is a mere *interpreter* of preexisting technical knowledge, with no operating influence over the nature of the materials it tries to classify, we should expect only that the source material for such classification belongs to a defined **system** (category, technique, etc) with real agency in the world, and reject unstructured inputs as unclassifiable or non-technical. We will apply the following notions to help us circumscribe this idea of **system** (Quintanilla 2022):
- A technical system `T = [C,S,E]`, is an action system, characterized by its composition `C`, its structure `S` and its environment `E`
	1. Components `C = [M , I ]` of a technical system may be intentional `I` or unintentional `M`
		- Unintentional components include raw materials, energy and technical equipment, or material parts, previously available, incorporated into the system
		- The intentional components include system operators or users
	2. The technical system structure `S = [W,K]` is characterized by the `W` set of actions and transformation processes (work operations), and the `K` set of management or control actions of those processes, which consists of the normal operation of the system
	3. The environment `E = [O, R]` of the technical system is the set of specific entities with which the technical system interacts, between which we distinguish two subsets: the subset `O` of entities whose transformation, manipulation, or control constitutes the intentional purpose of the system, and the subset `R` of entities whose transformation actually occurs as a result of the operation of the system

This definition of the idea of system enables us to immediately identify (and broadly classify) the underpinnings of any defined set of technical information inputs. Yet, a working model for technical writing cannot stop at the interpretation and classification of technical information. The models we use to communicate information are strictly different from the models that give way to scientific or technical insights in the real world.

To understand how information is structured and *encoded* in a way that's most useful to our audiences, we'll present some communication principles next.
