## Introduction

## The workflow

## Dear members of the audience

### The reader



## Editing, style, and other generalities

### Writing content people want to read

### The unsuspected virtues of *Indexation*

### Elephant talk

### Addressing the *curse of knowledge*
The **curse of knowledge** means recognizing the fact that people come from different backgrounds and levels of expertise. Long exposure to a subject will make you take shortcuts in communication, so it becomes sparsely and to the point. This is great when communicacting with your peers within specific contexts, but something unsurprisingly puzzling to a newcomer in the field. To avoid this pitfall, one must assume a position of intellectual integrity, not arguing too much over the terms used (*logomachy*).

This implies a couple of things, namely...

- Do whatever you can to remain specific and consistent. Technical terms should never be replaced by synonyms, as they refer to specific things within your subject area
- Specificity is always relative to your set of documentation. Terms which are industry-standard and by all means applicable according to every manual or dictionary under the sun, might not be as effective if your intended audience has already grown accustomed to a way of doing things
- Terms and sentences should be structured consistently. For example, if you're giving instructions by a checklist or list of actions, you will always make clear which step you're refering to by assigning a visible number to it and initiating every sentence with an action verb
- Buzzwords should be eliminated altogether in favor of layterms. Acronyms should be avoided, and if not possible, they must be properly introduced and clearly indexed
- It should be made obvious whenever *terms, footnotes, lists, figures, tables* or any other element is indexed
- It should be made clear where a section starts *or* ends
- Do not take the navigability of your content for granted. If you land on any page of your set of documents, you should immediately be able to identify:
	- The branch of documentation it belongs to
	- The outline or hierarchy within the table of contents
	- The version, revision number, or publication date
	- The author, editor, or collaborator
	- The title, subtitle, or section number
	- The page number or individual identifier

### The distinction between *concept* and *idea*

We consider **concepts** and **ideas** as distinctly different rational units. For one part, *ideas* designate historical entities with evolutionary traits. Ideas change over time and across geographical space. Numerous disciplines operate with different notions of the same idea simultaneously. Different cultures hold conflicting views of the same idea. Different languages render ideas with varying levels of nuance and resolution. Ideas transcend the specific structure of the discipline or category that engenders them. Some names of ideas are *progress, quality, improvement, freedom, order, value, time, nation, democracy, virtue, happiness*, etc.

Concepts on the other hand are category-specific tools that provide operability to it. Modulations of the same concept may exist within a discipline, and equal terms may sometimes be used to designate different concepts. This is very succinctly exemplified in music. For a classical musician, the concept of time is naturally blurred; it depends on the director's indications, their ability, and the composer's engravings on the sheet music. Time-keeping in jazz works differently; there, the composer and the sheet music lose priority in favor of the band playing with *swing*, *in-the-pocket*, etc. For a recording engineer, the concept of time is closer to a physicist's notion of time; it rests on the precision of the clock on its tracking converters, the latency of its computer drivers, or the grid of its digital audio workstation. All these terms have risen as modulations of a single **concept of time**, but encapsulate very refined and distinct *flavors* of it.

When referring to technical terms, we shall never lose sight of whether we're talking about a concept or an idea, especially when they're seemingly intertwined.

> The Shakespearean notion of *world as stage* is the **idea** - the literary topic (or trope) of *world as stage* is the **concept**
